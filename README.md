# HTML templates

A set of html templates that i make for practicing core web coding skills.

Currently i am doing [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges. You can find my solutions at [my profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/AlexLevus). Feel free to leave a comment or give it a like.

### Run locally

1. Clone repo
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AlexLevus/html-templates.git
  ```

2. Install dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
3. Change context for the desired challenge in webpack.config.js
  ```js
  context: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/<directory name>'),
  ```
  
3. Run dev server
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  
4. Or build
